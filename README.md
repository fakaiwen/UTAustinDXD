This is the Final Project for the Digital Experience Design and Practice.

This project takes on a form as a proposal for the Coachella festival. What's shown here are files that demonstrates the design
concept, working files for the proof of concept, and videos and images of the proof of concept. 

The proposed project here for Coachella Fesival 2019 is named "The Glacier." It is in a nutshell a large outdoor installation that
aims both to bringing the sense of refreshment to desert context of the festival, and at the same time addressing gently on the
issue of global warming.

Included here are:

(1) Documentations demonstrating design concept, which includes: Ground Plan, Section, System Diagram, and Renderings.

(2) Working TouchDesigner file for the proof of concept.

(3) Images and videos of the proof of concept.
